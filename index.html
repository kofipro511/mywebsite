			<h2>Crypto Currency: What It Is and How It Works</h2>

			<p>Crypto currency, also known as digital currency or virtual currency, is a form of decentralized currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Unlike traditional currencies, crypto currency is not physical and exists only in digital form.</p>
			<p>The most well-known crypto currency is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, many other crypto currencies have been created, each with its own unique features and uses.</p>
			<p>One of the key features of crypto currency is its decentralization. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers around the world. This means that no single entity controls the currency or the transactions, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.</p>
			<p>Crypto currency can be bought and sold on crypto currency exchanges, and can also be used to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept it as payment. Some people also mine crypto currency by using their computer's processing power to verify transactions and earn new units of the currency.</p>
			<p>Overall, crypto currency has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money and finance. While it is still a relatively new and volatile market, it is worth keeping an eye on as it continues to grow and evolve.</p>
